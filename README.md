This is my custom code for my business's Business Central SaaS implementation.

Whilst Business Central is a great product for a small business (circa 10 employees, of which 4 are full users and the rest are "Team Members" for timesheet recording), it has some shortcomings for specific business operations, processes and expectations. I have also found that some features I would consider critical are not implemented, so I tried to implement them myself.

Note: I am not a professional developer or programmer. I am a Mechanical Engineer, who started out as a mechanic restoring classic Lancia cars for the family business, and now I am a director alonside my brother. So any code you see here is likely to be poor. Any good bits were probably done by someone else (I can't thank Dynamics Square enough for their initial work on the Item Search functionality (though I modified it considerably since) and on the Work Done field transferring from timesheet to journals, ledgers, orders etc) or via Google and even a tiny bit of ChatGPT...

I will add more to this eventually, but take a look around if you want to and see what you can find. Feel free to try it (as of writing it is compatible with BC 2023 Wave 1 with the Shopify Extension dependancy) and see what you like.

If anyone from Microsoft ever reads this (please let me know too) and takes ANY inspiration from this for future development then I'd be ever so pleased. Some small code tweaks can help usability dramatically, and I've done too many things to bother posting Ideas on your site!

Thanks, Tristan
